Group 1, project 1 

Proposal:
Our goal is to dig into the graduation rates in Indiana schools by separating out those students who received diplomas verses those who received waivers.
We'll examine the relationships between diploma rates and federal school grade; diploma rates and school size; diploma rates and school attendance; and any trends and outliers that appear in the data.

Data:
So far, we have Excel files pulled from Census.gov and https://www.doe.in.gov/.

Questions:
What is the differnece between the reported graduation rate and the rate of students recieving high school diplomas?
Is there a relationship between diploma rates and each school corporation's cohort sizes, teacher/student ratio, and poverty rate?
Are there any trends 2014 through 2019?
